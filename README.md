# NeteaseCloud-Player

This is a complete imitation NetEase cloud player project, including front-end view and back-end interface
It is mainly used for the project when I am looking for a front-end development internship. 
Thanks for the publicly provided NetEase Cloud interface: https://lianghj.top:3000/
